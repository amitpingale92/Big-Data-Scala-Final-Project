2. cd into directory
3. Compile the project with [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) using:
```
sbt package
```
4. Train model pipeline using:
 ```
 spark-submit --class ModelTrain --master local[*] --driver-memory 4G target/scala-2.11/scalasparktitanicproject_2.11-1.0.jar
 ```
5. Train model pipeline using:
 ```
 spark-submit --class ModelPredict --master local[*] --driver-memory 4G target/scala-2.11/scalasparktitanicproject_2.11-1.0.jar
 ```

## Notes
